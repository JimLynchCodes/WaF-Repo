# Vision
I live in New York f#%@*ng City, and I don't know how to make more friends here. 

_**WaF is a piece of software meant to connect people in real life.**_

There are some popular apps that already exist which try to do this, but to me none of them really cut it: 

- Facebook.com is just for family and people you already know

- Meetup.com turns out to be big group things where I'm not really engaged. 

- Dating apps are just about hooking up. 


WaF is different because WaF is about individuals who happen to exist in a similar place and time finding each other and becoming friends over common interests. 


# Concept Art

Initial sketch drawings of the pages in the WaF app.

# Data

For each enrivonment, have 1 mongo "database" with three collections to hold users, listings, and messages.

// TODO - describe each of the objects better- User, Listing, Message


# Sockets Architecture

To keep things realtime, most of the data transfer will happen via [socketIo](https://socket.io/docs/) events. Here's a diagram for the inial plan for the events for WaF app. 
_Note: the most up-to-date version of this is [here](https://docs.google.com/drawings/d/1oxLMYoFBzs7PLJfJP0kSswtDAGsNcgwF3tt53YYzvW4/edit?usp=sharing)- ask jim for permissions! :)_

# Code

## Front-End Code

The front-end code is a React webapp build with Gatsby (specifically, the awesome [TDD BDD template from Evaluates2](https://github.com/Evaluates2/Gatsby-Starter-TypeScript-Redux-TDD-BDD)).

_Learn more about the frontend in the README in [waf-frontend-gatsby](https://github.com/JimLynchCodes/WaF-Repo/tree/master/waf-frontend-gatsby)!_

## Back-End Code

The backend is a relatively simple [socket.io](https://socket.io/docs/) server that is just run with `node index.js`. 

_Learn more about the backend in the README in [waf-socket-server](https://github.com/JimLynchCodes/WaF-Repo/tree/master/waf-socket-server)!_


# Release Plan

// TODO ðŸ˜…

Basically, we need to set up three environments for dev, staging, and production. Then we can connect them to the CI / CD pipelines for the git branches dev, staging, and master (respectively).

### Releases
1. When features pass all the tests locally and looks good then the code is merged into dev and the ci pipeline deploys to the dev environment. 

2. If all good in the dev environment deployment, we merge the dev branch into staging and let the ci pipeline deploy to the staging environment.

3. If all good in staging, we merge the staging code to the master branch and let the ci pipeline deploy to the production environment.

_When deploying features from staging to production it's nice to leave git release tags as you go!_
